  You're insecure Don't know what for<br>
  You're turning heads when you walk through the do-o-or<br>
  Don't need make up to cover up<br>
  Being the way that you are is eno-o-ough<br>
  Everyone else in the room can see it<br>
  Everyone else but you<br>

  Baby you light up my world like nobody else<br>
  The way that you flip you hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
  But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell<br>
  You don't kno-o-ow<br>
  You don't know you're beautiful<br>

  If only you saw what I can see<br>
  You'll understand why I want you so desperately<br>
  Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe<br>
  You don't kno-o-ow<br>
  You don't know you are beautifu-u-ul<br>
  That's what makes you beautiful<br>

  So co-come on You got it wrong<br>
  To prove I'm right I put it in a so-o-ong<br>
  I don't know why you're being shy<br>
  And turn away when I look into your eye-eye-eyes<br>

  Everyone else in the room can see it<br>
  Everyone else but you<br>

  Baby you light up my world like nobody else<br>
  The way that you flip you hair gets me overwhelmed<br>
  But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell<br>
  You don't kno-o-ow<br>
  You don't know you're beautiful<br>

  If only you saw what I can see<br>
  You'll understand why I want you so desperately<br>
  Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe<br>
  You don't kno-o-ow<br>
  You don't know you are beautifu-u-ul<br>
  That's what makes you beautiful<br>

  Na Na Na Na Na Na Na- Na Na<br>
