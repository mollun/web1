  An empty street, an empty house,
  a hole inside my heart<p>
  I`m all alone The rooms are getting smaller
  I wonder how, I wonder why,
  I wonder where they are
  the days we had, the songs we sang together<p>
  And oh my love
  I`m holding on forever
  Reaching for a love that seems so far<p>
  So I say a little prayer
  And hope my dreams will take me there
  Where the skies are blue
  to see you once again my love
  Over seas from coast to coast
  To find the place I loved the most
  Where the fields are green
  To see you once again.. my love...<p>
  I try to read, I go to work
  I`m laughing with my friends
  But I can`t stop to keep myself from thinking
  oh no I wonder how, I wonder why,
  I wonder where they are
  the days we had, the songs we sang together
  And oh my love
  I`m holding on forever
  Reaching for a love that seems so far
  So I say a little prayer
  And hope my dreams will take me there
  Where the skies are blue
  to see you once again my love
  Over seas from coast to coast
  To find the place I loved the most
  Where the fields are green
  To see you once again
